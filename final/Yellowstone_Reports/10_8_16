		Hi Everyone ~<BR>
<BR>
First a correction; I mistakenly wrote the wrong name for Karen E. in her Wapiti report last night. &nbsp;Sorry Karen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally a day with sunshine and highs on the 50's this afternoon in Lamar.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Junctions ~ </strong>&nbsp;First thing in the dark this morning we could see nothing on the elk carcass in Lamar. &nbsp;We went down to Coyote to look for the Junctions to the south. &nbsp;While we were there, Bill H. found a nice grizzly coming to the carcass. &nbsp;For some reason, maybe a shy bear, he did not stay long and headed for the high country. &nbsp;We later saw it from Coyote heading up Amethyst. &nbsp;That was about it for the carcass during the first half of the day. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Chris a guide in the Park for the day did find the Junctions up on the Southern Divide Ridge. &nbsp;It is roughly south of Fishermen's. &nbsp;Annie and Dusty found them about the same time as the wolves formed a serpentine line winding up on the deep chocolate trails made by many that had passed that way before them. &nbsp;Dusty was on Dorothy's Hill and he could see the two leading grays that chased a black to the west. &nbsp;It was not a hard chase and I think that it is a chase that has happened many times before. &nbsp;I think that this is a male from the Prospect 996M Group. &nbsp;He is most likely smitten with the 4 females in the pack and thinks that he would be dandy as the alpha male. &nbsp;Both 907F and 969F currently get headaches when they see him. &nbsp;Breeding season will come soon enough. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
The females led their family of 11 higher and higher towards the skyline. &nbsp;The pups, of course, were hippity skippity all the way. &nbsp;The black stayed bedded off to the right of them and Dusty could see him. &nbsp;He did eventually start to head to the right in the direction of where the pack was. &nbsp;He stays just close enough to be annoying!<BR>
<BR>
We left Lamar and went to Antelope in hopes of finding them come over the top of Specimen. &nbsp;Not today. &nbsp;We had two groups of bunched up elk which gave us some hope until we noticed the bulls that were herding them. &nbsp;I guess those guys were still holding out hope for some breeding opportunities. &nbsp;We stayed for quite a while and then headed home.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>? Wolves ~ &nbsp;</strong>Deby did see two black wolves heading out Cache while we were watching the Junctions.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Wapiti ~ &nbsp;</strong>Busy day down in the Hayden Valley. &nbsp;Here is Alan C.'s report ~&nbsp;As we came out of the tree line heading into the Hayden Valley, how were we to know that we were passing all nine Wapitis just 70 yards away?&nbsp; It was before sunrise, we were hurrying to get to Grizzly Overlook to see if they were still on the carcass, and none of us looked between the river and the road at the Mary Mountain Trailhead.&nbsp; But there they were, eating an elk carcass that they had killed in the night.&nbsp; We missed them completely and we continued on to Grizzly Overlook.<BR>
<BR>
We arrived at Grizzly Overlook at about 7:10, and Jon and Karen E. were already there and they said that there were no wolves in sight, and that it looked like the carcass was completely gone.&nbsp; Hoping that the wolves were still in the area, we opted to go to the meadow for a slightly closer look.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes of searching, Karen E. said that she had three blacks to the west.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Moving across the road, we were able to see the three adult blacks and the gray female yearling trotting along the Mary Mountain Trail.&nbsp; The three blacks went up to the top of the cut bank to the south of Alum Creek, the yearling was in the flats below, and then they all started howling.&nbsp; We thought we heard answering howling from the west, but were unsure.&nbsp; The yearling kept looking back to the east, and sure enough, here came all four pups!&nbsp; We also saw two hikers who had no idea that they were sharing the trail with wolves.&nbsp; The pups raced across the flats and disappeared behind a swale at Alum Creek.&nbsp; By about 7:50, we had all of the Wapitis disappear into the tree line at Alum Creek, except for the alpha female.&nbsp; We assumed that the female was in front, and it was the earlier possible howling we had heard.&nbsp; Since the hikers were on the trail, we believed that we wouldn't see the wolves for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Of course, all of this time, we had several visitors with us, looking through our scopes, and taking pictures.&nbsp; However, at around 7:55, a young visitor, Gwyneth Webster, was looking back to the East and told her dad that there was a wolf that he needed to take a picture of.&nbsp; He did, and promptly told us all that he had a good picture of "the wolf behind us".&nbsp; He showed me the picture, and I realized it was the alpha female.<BR>
<BR>
The alpha female was trotting south above the river, but would occasionally stop to do a little mousing.&nbsp; Everybody moved back to Grizzly Overlook, where we were able to watch her as she continued south.&nbsp; Several cars did the classic, what are you looking at?.... a wolf was our reply.&nbsp; They immediately jumped out, and were able to watch the female as she continued down to the river near the island.&nbsp; As she went below the trees, and farther south, we all headed south.<BR>
<BR>
As I headed down the hill, I saw the female swimming the river a little farther down.&nbsp; I quickly snapped a few pictures as she got out and ran across the road.&nbsp; It was about 8:40 when she headed up a gully and started trotting north and west.&nbsp; Realizing she was heading towards the last sighting of the other wolves, I went back to Grizzly Overlook, climbed the hill, and arrived just in time to see her come down the next hill onto the sage flats.&nbsp; She stopped, howled, and then turned farther to the west and started running.&nbsp; And just about then, a visitor asked if we had seen the elk carcass next to the road at Mary Mountain?&nbsp; He showed me a picture of an elk which had obviously been killed and partially consumed by wolves.<BR>
<BR>
After watching the alpha female stop and howl a couple of times, continue running towards the western trees, and finally disappear into the trees about 9:00, several of us went to see the carcass.&nbsp; As we approached the Mary Mountain Trailhead, we saw that the NPS had already retrieved the carcass and were hauling it away.&nbsp; They said that they hadn't seen any tracks, but it was definitely scavenged by wolves, so we went out to the site.&nbsp; We found several wolf tracks, of at least two different wolves, and from the coagulation of the blood, we realized we had passed the entire Wapiti pack just 70 yards away earlier that morning feasting on the elk.... &nbsp;if only I had looked left as I came out of the trees into the Hayden!<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Grizzlies ~ </strong>&nbsp;Bill found grizzlies Raspberry and Snow at 10:15 today near Lake Butte. &nbsp; &nbsp;At 2:05, from Antelope, Bill found a dark grizzly near a location called Gunsite by bear watchers and then went out of sight in 1/2 hour back into the trees. &nbsp;Tonight at 6:30, Bill had a nice grizzly on the Number 3 Finger of Norris and then it went across the Number 4 Finger of Norris in the Soda Butte Valley. &nbsp;Bill said that 5 grizzlies was a very good day for this time of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Until tomorrow,<BR>
