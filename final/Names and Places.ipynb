The Prospect wolves were on a carcass that is in the dried up pond west of Boulder in Little America. The carcass itself was out of view but we could see coyotes, eagles, ravens, and magpies. By the time we got there, the wolves had moved off of the carcass and had moved east to the north of Boulder turnout. We had alpha female 821F with her signature scar under her right eye, gray alpha male 966M who has lost his collar, 996M, the grayish black male, and 964M. Those five were howling to 2 gray pups and a black pup that we saw to the south. I am sure that they would have liked to cross but we just had too many people, so 821F crossed back over to join her pups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the early afternoon, 996M and two others were seen at the carcass once more but , again, not for long before they were off to the west again.

      "Prospect ~ As we always say, \"Feast or Famine\". Today was a hard one and many, many thanks you's have to go out to Evan from the Wildside. He was at Fishermen's scanning with his clients and spotted the very last wolves disappearing into a fog bank on top the southern Divide Ridge heading to skyline. What luck! They were out of sight by the time we got there, but Rick was able to re-aquire them as they came out of the cloud and crested the top of Specimen. It was momentary as they soon all disappeared over the top and we did not see them again. \n",
      "\n",
      "We thought that they were Junctions as it was exactly in the same place they were in on 10/9. When we got a count of 12, we knew that something was a miss. Rick checked signals and got 996M which meant Prospects. Doug M. saw 763M limping along with them. We feel that there were 14 recently, but this is a time of dispersal, so maybe they are down a few. \n",
      "\n",
      "It reminded me of the time the Prospects came over in March and killed Lamar Canyon alpha male 925M. The whole family was over at that time and led by Twin, Mottled, Dark Black and 965M. I think some time in there, 821F the Prospect alpha female, wondered what they were doing out of their territory and returned quickly to their Blacktail territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most often the males are out to find females and the family realizes that they don't need to drag along for that!! Those Prospect males know that there is a pack with no alpha male and 4 breeding females so that instinct is guiding the whole pack at the moment. \n",

One visitors showed us lovely photos of all 6 including the white female, 712M, the gray adult female, a dark black, a gray pup, and a black pup with a lot of gray in it. There was a carcass which was pretty much gone by the end of the day. I did not get any reports of people seeing them today. At least we know that they are alive and kicking. The alphas will be 12 in April; real old timers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospects ~ Calvin found wolves on the carcass this morning near Boulder. The total count was 5 grays and 2 blacks. When we arrived, there was howling on both sides of the road. We went to Boulder and found Prospect 964M, a gray yearling and 996M heading to the east looking towards the road. We could not find the wolves to the south. They must have been in the trees directly south of Boulder. The three wolves did successfully cross the road and the howling stopped. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later, Bonnie from the Wildside spotted a gray way back by the tree line north of the river. We soon had alpha female 821F, alpha male 966M (missing collar), and good old 763M heading along the trail they take to Junction Lake. However, they took a turn to the north towards the Trough which is way up to the north. We lost them going into it and some went to Hellroaring to look for them to appear there. No luck there. \n",

      "Junctions ~ After the Prospects all disappeared, we went to Antelope, and Brad N. found the Junctions heading across the slope far to the west end of Antelope. We got a count of 9, but at that distance we could have missed a few and it was impossible to tell who was who and get a color count. The sun is right there in your eyes so all viewing is tough. We lost them in some new growth forest and did not see them again.\n",

      "Prospect 996MGroup ~ Linda H. discovered the Prospect 996M Group on top of the Jasper Bench. They were all bedded and we had a count of 8, 5 blacks and 3 grays. When they began to move, we were able to get a good look as to who was who. We had some behavior that explained a lot about what is happening with these wolves. The big male that is blackish with lots of silver tinges is the dominant male in this group or would be the alpha male if they stay together. When I first saw him, he was on top of 964M with his front legs wrapped around 964's backend. That was very telling and then the male went over and scent marked, raised leg, on a bush and a female came along with some gray on the belly and a large bar-like chest mark and scent marked over the males marking with a flexed leg urination. That is a huge indication that this would be the alpha pair if this group of wolves continue together. He has a huge bar on his chest and she has one, too, so that helps. Others there included a gray pup, 996M, the dark-throated female yearling, the dark black male that has been with this group, and another black yearling. \n",
      "\n",
      "The group were all full as ticks so possibly a carcass in the area. We left them all sacked out and went to Antelope to look for Junctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we returned from the Junctions, 996M and group were bedded just on the south side of the road as you come out of Lamar Canyon East. Those that had stayed with the them had them leave the bench and go tot he west thinking that they would come out on the Slough side but that did not happen. The circled back and stayed on the Lamar side just a little south and west of Fishermen's Pullout. We had 6 bedded on and around the rocks. The two missing were the gray pup and the black yearling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again the dominant female came over and did a flex leg urination. The gray female yearling was there and when she saw the black female she crouched down and tucked her tail as the black gave her a good look over. Then the black female went to the dominant male and poked him. He did get up and he put his head over her back and licked her shoulders. \n",
      "\n",
      "964M came up and he saw the dominant black male and began to quietly tip toe very slowly away from him before bedding. So again, submissive behavior from the gray female yearling and 964M to the dominant pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The males headed south onto a little ridge flat on the west end of the bench. 964M went off to the right by himself and we did not see him again or the two females. We left around 5:15 with the black males still bedded.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 6:20, additional wolves come in. There was a count of 10, so I guess two more had joined the party. The main one was 966M the alpha male from Prospect. He must be suspicious of this other \"dominant male\" we are calling Black Bar. When 966M came in Black Bar was very submissive to 966M as was 964M. Ahhhhh...things change when the big guy is in town. That is why he probably came back from the Blacktail to see what mischief his wolves were in. I do not think that Black Bar is a Prospect but maybe came in like Twin did from another pack maybe outside the park. Black Bar must know that he is not related to the females. Anyway, Big Daddy 966M came back into town to sort things out amongst is rebellious underlings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good old 763M is relaxing on the Blacktail in his retirement years happy that he is not having to deal with such things!    \n",
      "\n",
      "Junctions ~ Doug M. had them when we arrived this morning. They, too, were all sacked out. It was a while before they started to stir. The female yearling had been up and antsy for the others to move so when she saw them stirring, she returned to them to rally the troops. 907 and 969 took the lead and the others followed. We had ten; missing one gray pup. The black female yearling had her tail in the air as has been the case the last couple of months. The two female mothers, 969F and 907F, seem to have a good, strong bond. That will all change when the breeding season draws closer. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they began to travel, we had no idea how far they would go. They just kept going and going crossing the whole expanse of Antelope from the west side to the east side. Antelope is about 4.5 miles south from the Tower store. They traveled down to Antelope Creek and we thought that we had lost them but they popped up going up the slope out of the creek. They continued on and soon we had elk running everywhere with the wolves right on their heels. We had calves and cows in complete chaos. The wolves did come close to a calf and I believe I saw one making contact with a cow. We did lose them for good then as they disappeared on the heels of the elk into a gully with lots and lots of trees.\n",

      "Well, it truly is feast or famine. Today was tough for finding wolves. We looked from Coyote Overlook to Little America, to Antelope to Hellroaring and the Blacktail. The winds were whipping but at least the temperatures were mild in the fifties. It was actually a bit strange. We had a thick cloud cover and it did start to rain midmorning picking up later in the day. Hayden Valley had very strong winds and rain. No reported sightings there. \n",

Not in sight very long, but just enough time to see that there was a big jet black extra male. 926F was leading all the way as they made their way to the east in the Prairie. It was raining pretty hard by then. 949M was bringing up the rear as he has acquired a limp. All of them looked very healthy. When I saw them last, the two females were scratching so hope the ravages of mange does not come back to them. It sometimes will reoccur in the winter. \n",

      "\n",
      "Prospects ~ Heading straight to the east, we started looking from all pointsin Little America. Larry and Linda were at Boulder making the first spot with 2 blacks on the ridge just below the high point on Specimen well to their east. Jim H. had gone to a vantage point near Longs when he heard a group howl to the south west. From Slough and Bob's Knob we were able to see 7 wolves at skyline back to the west just above 9's den meadow. These were the Prospects. They spent most of an hour mainly bedded in that area with the typical getting up, stretching and plunking back down. We had howling coming from the east. From Laurie ~ A this point they had 11 in view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, feeling a bit of motivation to perhaps move to the east to check out the answers to their howls. For the most part, they stayed on the skyline. Moving to thewest to perhaps get a closer look we were able to pick them up continuing to the east mostly in view. They stalled out just before making it to the trail going up Specimen from the Crystal lot. Sitting at the skyline and looking to the east all of a sudden tails went flying in the air and the wolves charged to the east. Having to move to Slough to see where they ended up. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were reports of perhaps another pack further to the east, but it appears they were just having a bit of trouble recognizing more of their own pack. As we counted greys and blacks and collars it became evident we had more blacks than normal. As the grey pups were playing back in the sage there were two blacks on the closer side of the wolves that were pups! After a considerable time where we thought the black pups were perhaps no longer with us, there they were looking fat and sassy. Wherever they have been and whoever they were with they have done well.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Lynette and Calvin later in the day ~ The Prospects were sleeping and a cow elk started down Specimen Trail above them taking lots of time looking down. The cow elk finally got down to a point where the Prospects got interested. The wolves did move her to the trees west of the trail. They moved east below the ridge and bedded again. We went in when they were flat out.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Laurie ~ Doug is fairly certain that he saw 821F but others think that she was not there. I hope that Doug is right. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lamars ~ There were early indications the Lamars may have been around to the east but not promising enough to search diligently for them. With Dunraven closed, we couldn't look for the Junctions from Antelope.\n",

      "It was a tough day for finding wolves. Nothing with the Lamars and a slight hope with 996 but nothing until a black was spotted by a visitor in the Slough Creek area north of the road from Aspen. Calvin, Lynette and others did see it but lost it quickly and they could not find it again. It was like the sage just swallowed it up. They looked for a couple of hours with no luck. It could have been a pup from one of the packs. We think that they are traveling around a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, it is thought by some that the 3 wolves to the east of the Prospects were actually Junction pups that were away from the pack. They seemed to run from the Prospects instead of going to them. It is thought that one year we lost some Junction pups just due to them wandering off and not being able to find their pack. That could be the case here.\n",

      "Later in the day, Rick did spot a gray just west of the talus outcropping north of Fishermen's. It did have a collar and he was getting his signal so most likely him.

I spent a lot of time at Lamar Canyon West with lots of interesting activity in view but no wolves. There was a very large herd of elk out in the flats below the Marge Simpson Tree and later in the morning they started up the pass single file.\n",

      "\n",
      "Junctions ~ From Laurie ~ Finally, they did find some wolves today thanks to the report of wolves from a guide from Jackson. He had them up by the Tower Store on the ridge to the east. Later, folks like Jim B. and others did see 3 blacks and 2 grays, most likely Junction wolves. Later in the morning, some of the Junctions were seen from the Curve Lot in Little America by visitors. This evening, Junction 969 was very loud from Coyote Overlook but despite looking long and hard for her, they were not able to spot them. 994M was not with them. I am thinking that he is dispersing, and Rick said that that will make it easier for the Prospect males to come in. \n",
      "\n",
      "Canyons ~ From Fay and Dale B. We came in through the West Entrance. We couldn't get to Hayden (roads closed due to snow)so we went as far as Old Faithful. On our way outbefore reachingMadison Junction and just crossing over the bridge overthe Gibbon River, we saw birds and a coyote out in the meadow. A couple from PA saw a white flash come out of the ditch in the distance at 5:30 PM, and we saw an Aussie's photo of the White Canyon alpha female (she was seen carrying a chunk!) At 5:45, out of the ditch (the part of the river that you couldn't see) came 712M carrying a smallish ribcage, possibly a deer.  Also saw very briefly a darker gray wolf with them, also seen carrying a chunk. They had forded the river and headed east into the trees.\n",

      "Grizzly ~ We had something to look for in the Lamar and it became focused around the Ranch. I was at Hubbard Hill where we had a group of elk bunched with their bull at skyline. They were focused and paying close attention to something below them. It turned out to be a grizzly that made its way up the hill just to the east of the elk where it also made the skyline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Junctions ~ From well to the east the Junctions were spotted well above where the old bison carcass was on Ranger Hill. We had a great view from Hubbard Hill but if you were much closer they were just over the rise and out of sight. A black pup was the first to stir. She as we were soon to discover was waddling rather than walking. Full as can be and not moving very fast. Others stirred and eventually got up and also worked their way slowly up the hill to the north. Not making it over the top but bedding once again they had a grey come from the direction they were heading and that brought our total to 4 or 5 greys and 3 blacks. All three blacks were pups, 969F and 907F were amongst the greys that included two pups and perhaps the red faced grey that joined them was also a pup. Yes.... they have a carcass most likely taken some time during the night. From further to the east there was a report of a grizzly tugging on a carcass briefly in the area where the wolves were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wolves advanced further to the north without much ambition and the greys bedded once again in view while the blacks made their way further north and east out of view from out vantage point. We had retreated to Picnic and out to the bank above the river to keep an eye on them. 969F remained in view and was occasionally joined by other greys that were most likely bedded just over the ridge and out of view. 907F joined her sister as the two of them became the hub for occasional visits from the other greys. No dominance was shown by either of them. I left with them still in view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calvin and Lynette arrived just as everyone else was leaving ~ We had 3 blacks and 4 greys bedded on a lower ridge east side of Ranger Hill. We started loosing them heading behind a ridge. Calvin found them again farther to the east, and then lost them in heavy sage.\n",
      "We drove to YES dirt lot, just east of the Ranch, to look. I finally found them between tree tops lower. Calvin then got a count of 4 blacks. We had them milling around between two rows of trees. They headed west behind Ranger hill around 12:20. We left at 3:30 without ever seeing them again.\n",
      "Calvin and Lynette looked from Elk Creek and Blacktail today and found nothing.\n",
      "Canyons down south from Dale and Fay ~ Heard the Canyons at 7 AM. There was a great howling session, but never saw them; just a coyote messing with the hide. At 7 PM the same coyote returned and was messing with the hide, again ! Got through finally to Hayden Valley which had poor visibility. No sign of 755 or Wapiti anywhere. Maybe the weather will change soon.\n",
      "Back to Doug ~ Dunraven remained closed this morning and the road from Norris to Canyon was also closed so getting around in the southern part of the park was difficult unless you wanted to see Old Faithful!\n",

      "Grizzly ~ From guide Cara McGary ~ On my evening tour, we had a nice big grizzly across Soda Butte Creek from Soda Butte Cone. I did not have any wolf sightings, but it does seem that there is a carcass to the south of the western trailhead for Specimen Ridge, just as you come into Little America. There were several juvenile bald eagles and golden eagles feeding there.\n",

      "From Doug ~ I knew the day was going to be good from the very early sightings I had. I haven't seen a pine martin since my time in Silver Gate, and this morning I had one cross the road near Lava Creek. Just a couple of miles later it was a fox that crossed the road, and then a beautiful mule deer buck. Great drive and as it started to get light out we were looking for the Lamars from Geriatric above Confluence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamar Canyon ~ Josh A. reported a grizzly on a carcass just east of Footbridge. Slowly the interest in finding the Lamars south of Confluence waned and people started heading east. I didn't get there in time to see the grizzly on the carcass on the south bank of Soda Butte Creek but got photos as it passed behind the trees east of Dead Puppy Hill. Hmmm, a carcass and a grizzly, this was a better place to be looking for the Lamars.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit later we got a break as I heard a howl directly south of the eastern turn. Lots of eyes looking from everywhere from Soda Butte Cone to Footbridge and Jim B. is the one who struck gold! He found 3 of the Lamars up in the trees east of Dead Puppy and you could only see them from Jim's vantage point near the apex of the curve in the road. 926F was bedded in an area affording the best view with 949M higher up the hill with another black straight above 926F. There was very little movement. I was taking a video when 926F got up and did a quick turn around before plunking down again. She was quite full. One of the blacks made its way to the left to eat some snow before heading back to its bedding place.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then..... the grizzly went to a nice bedding spot about 10 yards from 949M and just above 926F. Nobody stirred, this bear is like a member of the pack! The first time we saw the \"new\" Lamars, this bear was with them! Yesterday when only tracks were found at Soda Butte Picnic the tracks were wolves and a grizzly! He eats at their kills and stays with them. Rick commented this morning..... imagine if the Mollies come into the area and make a charge at the Lamars who politely step aside and introduce the Mollies to their newest member. Who really knows the total nature of this relationship but we do know the Lamars are very comfortable in close presence with this bear and the bear wants to be with them. Go figure!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little repositioning between the grizzly and 949M, but all was very calm and easy going. They were all bedded still when I left. They look great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afternoon from Calvin and Lynette ~ Around 1 PM or so,we did see the dark uncollared black moving west and lost him behind a boulder. A few minutes later Calvin said he was heading up slope then realized it was the grizzly.The grizzly came from where we lost the black. I did have another one re-bed just a little east. The last sighting was 1pm and we left at 3:30.\n",
      "\n",
      "This evening with the Lamars from Bill H. ~ They watched the bear and the wolves get up and move from east to west across Dead Puppy Hill and onto the flats where they lost them around 7 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti from Don P. ~ Hi Laurie wanted to e-mail while I had service.  I'm at Cascade Meadow looking to the north side, and have a carcass with wolves and grizzlies.  I've seen 3 grays and 1 black and 1 grizzly.  Others did see 6 wolves and a sow with 2 yearling cubs before I got here.I did see the white wolf I called it a gray and one of the other grays was big with and very dark on the upper part of body. From Laurie ~ The gray that Don saw did have a collar and is most likely 1013M from the Mollies Pack. The other collared gray in the Mollie Pack is 978F. I don't think that she would have been welcomed by the two female adult Wapitis.\n",

      "Later in the day from Don P. ~ I ended up seeing another black which was collared so I had a total of 5, the alpha female and 2 other grays, and 2 blacks one of them collared. Mark may have had a 3rd black. At about 2:15 they started howling and moving east through the forest and we lost them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canyons from Natalie and Warren ~ Canyons were seen this AM at 8:15 at Fountain Flats. They crossed west to east to the Mary Mountain Trail. The count was white alpha female, 712M, 1 black, and 3 grays. They lost them into the trees. Thanks to Steve Henry for photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies from Bill H. ~ Bill did see the grizzly at Cascade Lake but not the youngsters. His friends, Jim and Twyla did find a pretty blond grizzly south of Trashcan. And then at 6:30, he had the grizzly that has buddied up to the Lamar Canyons.\n",

      "\n",
      "From Doug ~ It was a relatively warm morning with cloudy skies and little wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamar Canyon ~ We headed straight to the Lamar this morning in hopes of seeing the Lamars again. They were in the area but there were no strong indications as to where they were. I was on my way to Footbridge to look from there when Bill H. from Footbridge called for people to come to Footbridge. Arriving within a minute Bill had a big smile on his face and pointed to the willows just on the other side of Soda Butte Creek.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the darkness you could see a black in the grass and one behind the willows and another further to the right. They were right there!\n",
      "949M was the first to rise and that was a signal to others to get up, stretch and lets go! It's difficult to get photos in that low light but fortunately there was a pause here and there where one or two were standing still and they could be captured by camera. At one point Little T went over to where the big black male had rolled in something. She found it and tossed it in the air and also rolled on it, then tossed it again being very playful. 949M led the way this morning with a slight limp but a steady pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were quickly on their way out to the Middle Flats andon to the trail taking them to Cache. There was a noticeable disappointment amongst those viewing the procession.... the grizzly wasn't with them. Hopefully we will see them together again in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved to the west to try and keep an eye on the Lamars as they headed toward Cache. As they got out along the tree line they turned toward the Lamar River and some were seen later from a great distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had moved to Hellroaring to look for wolves amongst the vast numbers of elk and bison when we heard they were looking for both Junctions and Prospects back to the east. We went back to Elk Creek to look from there but came up empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospect 996M ~ Lynette and Calvin ~ Mid afternoon to early afternoon, everyone was looking from Canyon Westto the Curve Lot. Then we saw the plane and moved more to the west side of Little America. Leo found a black heading through Buffalo Ford. Then Kelly found a bedded uncollared grey. The black disappeared into west side of Mom's Ridge. Calvin and I headed to Elk Creek to see if we could find the rest. Bill H. was there and had a grizzly on the ridge going to Junction Lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then heard they had more in Little America and they were heading east. Fay found them in front of the Marge Simpson Tree by Slough Creek.Then we lost them behind the hill going south.We went to Aspen and guessed wrong again. They moved back where Fay had found them. The wolves included 996M, 964M, an uncollared grey, and 3 blacks. From Laurie ~ This group looks like the one that has splintered off. Others from the pack stop into visit and do some pinning and have apparently left. I would guess that the 3 blacks included the grayish black, Black Bar, the female Halter Bar, and the dark black with a small white spot. The uncollared gray female was most likely the dark throated one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight Bill H. said the 996M Group headed out of sight at 5:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down South from Barb M. ~ No wolves so far today. Checked for Canyons and Wapitis. Checked from West entrance almost to Old Faithful. And to Hayden Valley and on to Fishing Bridge. Saw 2 foxes, 2 solo grizzlies, several coyotes and (drumroll please) a burrowing owl. The owl has several burrows so we saw it fly several times between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill H. with the grizzly report ~ Bill had 3 grizzlies. One early discovered by Dusty south and west of the confluence. Don picked the same grizzly up tonight straight south of Trashcan. Lynette mentioned one of the grizzlies above in the Junction Lake area. At 6:15 Bill had a dark grizzly in the Old Druid Rendezvous from Picnic.\n",

      "\t\tHi Everyone ~\n",
      "\n",
      "From Doug ~ It was a beautiful morning/day in the park with lots of sunshine and not real frigid temps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started looking from Dorothy's and found 3 moose out in the Old Druid Rendezvous area. Moving closer to get a better look at them I went to Trashcan. As the moose made their way back toward the trees I found another visitor we don't see every day.... a badger! The badger stood quite tall and moved with purpose and finally found the right spot. They are such great diggers, within a couple of minutes the badger broke ground then quickly moved enough dirt to be under ground and out of sight. To the south west from Trashcan hill there was a very handsome grizzly grazing in the grass along the edge of the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamar Canyon ~ We were looking for the Lamars again to the south of the road but not having any luck. I moved to Footbridge and just barely got set up when the call went out the wolves were chasing an elk.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was going past Confluence I could see the elk and the wolves heading to the river with the elk well in the lead. Before I got parked below and east of the Exclosure the wolves were dropping out of the chase. Out of the 4-Runner I watched the elkreach the river and quickly cross, and then crossed the road and on up the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "949M has such a presence standing on the first rise surveying the pack as all but LittleT and 926F who were catching their breath. LittleT came far enough to see if the elk was in the river and 926F was a hundred yards or so ahead of her. They surveyed the area deciding this one got away and they turned back to the males.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started through the thick sage toward the Old Druid Rendezvous area and eventually made it to the grass just beyond the sage. What looked to be a tail wagging rally quickly turned to a disciplinary action as 949M quickly pinned the smallest male. The other large male stood back until all tails were wagging again. They bedded briefly in that area and then proceeded to the east.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grizzly that has been with the Lamars emerged from the trees to the left of the Chalcedony fan. After I left the Lamars again headed out toward Cache then turned back toward the river. There is enough to eat in the Lamar now to keep these wolves from wandering too far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim and Joyce went through Lamar about 6:00 PM and did not see anyone looking at the Lamars this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down South today from Barb M. and others ~ I had another two-dog day -- coyotes and a fox but no wolves. One coyote was very entertaining and I snapped a photo of him in midair which I will email in a few minutes. I also saw 3 grizzlies (Nez Perce Creek, Otter Creek and LeHardy Rapids). Plus the burrowing owl again today and 9 swans (two on Yellowstone Lake and the rest on the Yellowstone River from Otter Creek to Trout Creek). All this while searching for the Canyons and Wapitis. Same as yesterday, I checked from West to Biscuit Basin to Norris to Cascade Meadow thru Hayden to Fishing Bridge but no luck. One item of interest— on my last trip to Cascade Meadow, around 5:00, I saw 25-30 elk running into the forest at the western edge of the meadow. From the road, I was able to follow them for several hundred yards. They gradually slowed and then drifted deeper into the forest and disappeared. Needless to say, I was hoping wolves were the cause but there weren’t any to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warren and Natalie also looked for Wapiti and Canyons today but had no luck. They, too, saw the grizzly tot he east side across from Fountain Flats. They, too, had the grizzly just on the west side just pass Otter Creek picnic right at the pullout 20 yards from the road. After an hour the grizzly crossed the road and went down to the river where we found him on an elk carcass just below us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter G.'s report from down south ~ In the early morning (2nd hand report from 2 different people) three wolves spotted in south side of Cascade Meadow, and a gray wolf was spotted outside of old Canyon Village Cabins, before sunrise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies from Bill ~ I had four grizzlies today. At8:00 AM there was a small blonde grizzly south and west of the tree line from Trashcan. The same bear was on Amethyst Bench this evening. At 9:00 AM, I found a very large grizzly north of Boulder heading toward the Trough. At 2:00 PM, Paul S. saw grizzly high in the Bear Meadow south of the Institute and then it went into the bowl and they had it all day until 6:15 tonight. A dark grizzly was found in the Old Druid Rendezvous area tonight.\n",

      "Another day of sunshine in the park. Some high clouds and slight breezes but generally it was very comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slowed quickly for a couple of moose crossing the road at Lower Hellroaring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Junctions ~ On to the Lamar, and today we were looking for the Junctions. As I was passing Y.E.S. and approaching Hubbard Hill I could see some wolves in the sage on the south side of the road. From Hubbard we could see the wolves were going south toward the river with a black pup carrying a large piece of carcass. We watched the sage to see if there was indeed a carcass there. There were some ravens and magpies, and there was a coyote with additional ravens and magpies at the water's edge. The coyote was chewing on a very large piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark R. climbed the hill behind us to see if the area of the carcass could be confirmed. Five Junctions with the two collared females, two greys and the black pup bedded on the north side of the river in a sandy area. We also had grizzlies in view from this location with one up quite high in the bowl and one to the east along the trees. We also had the 3 moose again out in the old Druid Rendezvous area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospects ~ With bedded wolves I went back to the west where Calvin and Lynette had a black by Curve. When I arrived at Curve Lot the black was out of sight but there were reports of 3 blacks crossing to the south. We had a collared grey out by the old bison carcass just north of Curve. This wolf went east and I'm fairly certain it was 821F who circled around behind us at Curve on the south side then went up and over the hill to the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later we had a black and 4 greys out in the Buffalo Ford area moving up the trail and behind the trees on the usual route. Moving to Rick's Pullout and later to the Petrified Tree lot, we were able to watch two large groupings of elk above the small basalt cliff. The black showed up in the grass basically between the two groups of elk and then two greys were also there but then dropped into a drainage. We later had fleeting views of them as they made it over the hill and into the Trough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti from Barb M. ~ This morning, I checked for Canyons and Wapitis in the same areas as yesterday, without success. I returned to Hayden Valley at 12:15. From the pullout north of Alum Creek, I was able to see 4 Wapitis, (2 black males and 2 gray pups). One of the males was digging in the mud flats and appeared to be trying to eat something. He would not allow the puppy to dig or eat whatever it was. He snapped at the pup 2-3 times. Meanwhile the other pup was back and forth, up and down in the grass and on the mud flats. The other black male was sleeping. I saw the 3rd gray pup emerge from the forest on the left (north). I decided to move to the south side of Alum for better views. One by one, most of the pack moved around enough to be identified. By 1:30, I had seen 8 of the Wapitis - the alpha female, the gray yearling, 3 black adults and 3 gray pups - missing only the black pup. Generally the adults were sleeping. They all looked good with healthy coats, ready for winter. I left at 2:00, with the 8 of them sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canyons from Barb M. ~ I heard reports that the Canyon Pack was seen late this morning at Norris Junction. From Laurie ~ Several reports about the sighting from Natalie and others. There was a lot of looking but the Canyons were never found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8 Mile from Kim and Joyce ~ We were at Nature Trail lot around noon and, after we had been looking for an hour; around 1:00, Geoff F. found way out to the west on the south side of the road 7 (4 blacks and 3 grays) wolves standing on the ridge near Wraith Falls. From Laurie ~ Because there were so many Prospects back to the east, I am thinking they must have been 8 Miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzliesfrom Calvin and Lynette ~ We started at the North Butte lot where yesterday we had 4 coyotes on a bison carcass. When we could see, we had 3 grizzlies. The one on the carcass was not going to give it up. He spent most of the time covering it up. I thought the one above looked bigger but he did not challenge him. He headed to the east. The one below tried a couple of times but was unsuccessful and moved off up the hill. We had 4 coyotes that rushed in when the bear was chasing the other one away, but he was too quick getting back to the carcass. When Doug went through later he had only coyotes on the carcass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies from Bill ~ There were 4 grizzlies reported by Bill today. At 7:40 this morning we had a dark grizzly south of Hubbard Hill.  There was another one this morning high in the bowl about the same place as yesterday. A blonde grizzly was digging at Amethyst Bench from 3:30 to 4:30 and then again later this evening. Kim and Joyce found a large grizzly south of Hitching Post and it was out again this evening as well.\n",

      "I headed straight to the Lamar again today and started watching from Hubbard Hill where we had a reasonable chance of finding Junction 969F. She was there yesterday and there were indications she was in the area this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an early grizzly on Amethyst (thanks Bill H.) and it was around for some time slowly moving to the east. We searched the entire area hoping to find 969F and the rest of the pack, or find the moose trio again, but time dragged on and bottom line, no moose, no Junctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospect ~ I was just in the process of folding up the scope when Fay B. said she had wolves! And she did, 7 Prospects on the Amethyst bench. They moved to one spot they found very interesting and every wolf in the pack scent marked and ground scratched that spot! That is except 763M who was the last to arrive. He went to the spot and then was met by a female and instantly a large black male. The male was dominant over 763M who remained on his feet with his tail lower and his head was down. His ears were back but he wouldn't totally collapse. The black mounted him and grabbed at the back of his shoulders but 763M held steady. Mounted a second time, he held his own again. Finally there was tail wagging and all was well.\n",
      "\n",
      "966M and 821F were not with this group today. This was the splinter group with the addition of 763M.  964M and 996M were there but 964M held back with his tail held high observing who was doing raised legs and cocked legs. The uncollared dark throated dark female was there with Black Bar, Halter Bar and the Small Dot male. They ventured down to the flats very briefly and then returned to the bench and went south into the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, they reappeared behind the trees and could be seen from Dorothy's. They bedded in sight. Poor 763M; walking he can get by with barely a limp at times, and at other times he skips a beat with the paw held in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "We watched him from Hellroaring the day he became an alpha male, breeding both 821M and Third Sisterwith the three of them getting tossed out of the Eightmile Pack. He is a very handsome wolf who has made the best of things despite a severe handicap. He has been displaced as the alpha male by 966M but remains with the pack and contributes to their well being in his own way. He is no spring chicken and I feel so lucky to be in his presence each time I see him.  He is a very courageous wolf. Today was a very good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "This afternoon from Bill ~ At 3:15 the Prospects moved south into the trees. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6:00 tonight, they found them again coming down the ski slope and ending up just about the same place as they were this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Junctions ~ At 11:15AM, Bill and Anne went down below Bob's Knob and found the Junctions with 2 blacks and 3 grays moving basically near the Diagonal Forest. They disappeared after some very good viewing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bill found them again tonight around 5:00. There were 6 present; the two collared females, the 3 black pups and the uncollared female yearling. They made a big move to the west but did end up in the Slough Flats. From Laurie ~ Hard to tell what is going on with this pack. Parts of them are being seen but it has been a while since all of them have been together. We think that 994 may have dispersed. That leaves 2 collared females, the gray uncollared female yearling, the black female yearling, 3 black pups and 3 gray pups for a total of 10. It is amazing that just a few short months ago, we were watching all of them at Slough. What a difference a few weeks makes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti ~ Natalie reported seeing all of the Wapitis today in the Sour Creek Rendezvous. Karen found them first thing this morning. At first they only had the pups and then later all 9 showed up. They were somewhat active and bedded about. The pups found things to chew on and play with. Around 2:00, the rain set in down there and Natalie left. For those of the Northern Range it is a long slog around to Hayden with Dunraven closed for the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "? Wolves ~ At 10:45 this morning, Bill found 2 black wolves moving fast to the west looking north from Coyote.  From Laurie ~ I am thinking they were Junctions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies from Bill ~ At 7:45AM Bill found a grizzly on Amethyst Bench. He found him again around 3:30 this afternoon south of Picnic grazing and digging. From the Ranch at 2:45PM, Bill found another griz in the bowl moving north. They found him later around 5:30 tonight grazing and digging high on A-Z. \n",

      "Prospect main pack ~ I hadn't been at Coyote for long when we got the call that Dusty had wolves on the southern divide ridge from the Slough Lot. I got there in time to see 4 greys and a black go over the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hustling back to Coyote Bill H. had already spotted them coming through and heading on the well traveled trail up to skyline on Specimen ridge. The greys are really hard to pick out as they travel through the sage but when they get to the dark well traveled trail out in the open they are easy to spot. 821F and 966M were leading the way with 2 grey pups and a grey yearling coming up behind and the black which was lame was bringing up the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pups will be pups and when they spotted a small patch of snow the pups left the main trail and ran to the snow. The yearling grey wasn't quite as playful but thought about joining in. The 3 ended up below a patch of trees and hurriedly raced around the trees and onto the trail then to the top. In human terms we would have been bent over trying to catch our breath for maybe the third or fourth time. These guys found more snow at the top and played and played in thatthen just a bit later were racing all out after each other in a long patch of snow that had drifted over from the top. Bundles of energy! We lost them over the top so I headed back to the west but not before we had a dark grizzly spotted by Paul G. on the same trail the wolves were on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moose ~ When I got to Floating Island Lake it was a wonderful scene with a cow moose out in the water and grazing on vegetation under the surface of the lake. She would be up to her eyeballs in the water then raise her head with large amounts of vegetation dripping water. Her calf was behind her browsing amongst the cat tails. At one point it was at the waters edge maybe getting a drink or trying some of that vegetation just under the surface. Fun while it lasted but they did exit in a hurry over the ridge behind the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti ~ Carol texted me this morning that she had the Wapiti adults eating on a carcass from Alum Creek to the west. They also said that pups were on the east side of the road south of the Western Point of Trees. Carol said that she heard from others there that the alpha female and gray female yearling went over to the pups and then went back to the carcass. I did not hear anything else about later in the day and evening. \n",

      "Grizzlies from Bill ~ 825 top of A to Z the same bear that was there last night and he was in view for several hours. At 8:45 Paul G. found a grizzly following the Prospects as they made their journey over the top and he followed right over the top as well (This same bear was mentioned above in Doug's report). At 9:00 the small blonde grizzly was out in the tree line southwest of the confluence. He was out again at 4:00 and then again at 6:00 in the Druid Rendezvous. At 5:50 tonight I had a grizzly on Norris south of the Cache Creek Trail. \n",

      "From Doug ~ There was some wet pavement crossing the park early this morning but it's still way to warm for snow. No snow, way too warm, and the grizzlies are having trouble getting sleepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had reason to look for the Lamars early this morning but the chances began to decline within a couple of hours. No wolves this morning on the upper tier of the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had several views when returning to the west of bull elk still with harems. There should be a lot of calves next year! We haven't seen Bighorn sheep in Gardner Canyon for some time now and today there were several nice rams enjoying a nice ledge above the road. Good to see them again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti ~ from Karen E. ~ We arrived in Hayden a little before 8AM. There were already several other wolf watchers at the Alum Creek pull-out. Dusty pointed us in the right direction.  We decided we'd have better viewing on the hill across from Grizzly Overlook. We were right and before long we had 7 Wapitis in view; 2 blacks, 1 grey yearling and 4 pups. The alpha female was out of sight for approximately 45 minutes. During this time, the pups were very active, with the black adults supervising. \n",
      "\n",
      "The puppies were very playful, running and chasing each other, going to & from the carcass, tugging on it and leaving with large bones with all tails high and wagging. One collared male took a large bone to where the alpha female was bedded with several puppies following him with tails wagging.\n",
      "\n",
      "At about 9:30, the alpha female appeared and moved forward and down the hill. 1014M moved down the hill with her. They paused for a moment, and he howled. All the wolves came running towards them. The pack moved down the hill and out of sight for few minutes, but were back up by 10AM with all choosing just the right bedding site.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could see the alpha female, the three black males, and 1 grey bedded in the open. For the next couple of hours, the wolves stayed bedded with an occasional wolf shifting positions or moving to a different location. One of the grey pups moved to the carcass for a quick bite, then returned to the pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left at 1pm with all wolves still bedded right of the carcass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti afternoon ~ from Natalie B. ~ We returned at 3:00. The adults were still bedded. When they began to stir the yearling and 1015M stood up and headed left. The pups joined the yearling. The alpha female,1014M, and the female yearling went to the carcass. 1014M howled and brought the family together circling the alpha female who had a big bone that the pups were trying to get from her. We noticed today that one of the gray pups has a lot of white in its coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 4PM we watched them move south and out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doug reported that all 9 Wapitis were seen and the collared Mollie 1013M was there with them again today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzly ~ Kim and Joyce stopped by North Butte to check on an active carcass there and did find a grizzly there amongst other scavengers. They also had a beautiful fox at Baronette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill H. on grizzlies ~ At 7:30 we had a large grizzly in the Druid rendezvous area and he slowly moved over to Chalcedony. We had him for about 45 minutes or so. At 8:00 me and Kim found a grizzly up on Norris in some sage brush. We could not figure out what it was doing up there. We had him for quite a while and then Joyce found another grizzly in that same patch of sage brush. We guess that those two adult bears felt that it was quite all right to eat together up there in the sage. At 9:05 we had a grizzly high in the bowl south of the Institute. It was just up there digging. This is Bill's last report for the year. We are always so sad to see him go. The Park is not the same without him. We so appreciate his reports and his wonderful company. Adios good friend, see you in March. \n",

      "Cara M. had 821F on the Blacktail this morning and a visitor showed us photos of a grey Prospect in the area of the bison carcass by North Butte. So wolves were seen but not by very many people.\n",

      "We looked from Hellroaring for 969F but that also turned up nothing. Later hikers reported a carcass by the bend in the river at Hellroaring so I'm sure that area will be looked at in the morning.\n",

      "Grizzly report from Kim and Joyce ~ At 7:45AM, we had a griz on Norris by the Cache Trail. At 8:15 a griz was on the Upper Divide Ridge at the east end of Lamar Valley. At 8:30 there was a griz in the Bear Bowl south of the Institute. At 8:50, Mark and Carol found a grizzly in the Crystal Drainage area. At 4:00PM there was a big collared grizzly south of YES.  He actually took a bath in the river to the crowds delight. At 5:45 there was a griz silhouetted on the sky above the cliff bands south of Hubbard Hill. At 6:15 Geoff F. found a grizzly walking the road near the Montana/Wyoming border. He followed him for at least 20 minutes before he went off the road. Kim and Joyce were thinking that perhaps this was the grizzly that was with the Lamar wolves.\n",

      "The windshield wipers were on this morning heading to the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left later to start on the Blacktail Plateau. That turned up empty. As I was setting up to Hellroaring the word was out that the Mollies were in the Lamar. I headed that way and when I got to Coyote the Mollies were bedded at the far western end of the Jasper Bench. One....two, three...... all the way up to eleven. 890M was recognizable with the huge white bar across his chest and just behind him, bedded next to him was alpha female 779F. This is the first look we have had of 890M as the alpha male of the Mollies. We did see \"alpha\" scent marking by both of them but did not see them scent mark over each other. From Laurie ~ There was a big light colored gray that mounted 890M and there was a bit of shoulder slamming but nothing huge. It is enough, though, to maybe think they don't have all that figured out yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "They howled from their location and got an answer from a wolf somewhere out by Secret Passage. Lots of howling but we never did see the single wolf. The signal on 996M was being picked up so it was quite likely him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mollies began to stand up and stretch and start to head to the east. We had them most of the way across Jasper Bench. They crossed to the Amethyst Bench and eventually down to the sage bench where they continued to the east.Several of them did pause where the Prospects did a ton of scent marking but most moved on without marking the area themselves. We had3 collars today, 890M, 779F and the GPS 1013M collared grey. We also appeared to have 2 black pups out of the 4 the wolf project believes the Mollies had this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at the edge of the western foothill there were some bison coming out from behind the foothill. The Mollies noticed and soon the bison were on the run but most didn't go far and stood their ground with arched tails. Soon the Mollies got bored and continued to the east. I left heading back to the west just before they were lost in the trees. We won't know until the morning if this was just a day trip for the Mollies or if they plan on staying a while.\n",
      "Istopped at Hellroaring to check on the Junctions but only found a grizzly on the carcass that was supposed to be in the area. The carcass and bear were in the water in a nice open gap in the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It continues to rain in Gardiner this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Laurie ~ Tonight, Joyce and Kim found through the rain and mist 5 blacks on the flank of Norris. Rick did come out and seemed to be getting Junction 969F. They did not see any grays but the visibility was so bad, she could have been there. If it is the Junctions, they have gained a black from somewhere; maybe the black that had been following them for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Laurie ~ When 890M realizes that 911 has died, he may look to those females once more. He is not related to 969F and 907F so that is something to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies ~ Kim and Joyce found a grizzly on Penny Lane after the Mollies had disappeared into the trees. About 45 minutes later, another grizzly was spotted on Amethyst Bench. A white ermine ran in front of their car near Coyote Overlook.\n",

      "Nearing Hellroaring there was a young black bear on the road, and it baled off the road to the north over the rock barrier.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prospect 996M Group ~ There were Prospects (996 Group) in the Lamar Valley spotted by Kim very near the Old Road. The group included the same band of 6; black 996M, gray 964M, Black Bar, Black Halter Bar, Black Small dot and the dark-throated female yearling.  They were heading west and wanted to cross the road between Dorothy's and Coyote but too much traffic kept them on the one side continuing west. .One of them went across the Lamar and up onto the Jasper Bench and it too made its way to the west.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of howling so they could all stay in touch. There was another attempt to cross to the north between Fisherman's and Coyote with 996M and another black making it across but before too long they turned back and crossed back to the south once again. After they met with others in the middle of the Lamar they headed to the east and toward the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mollies splinter group ~ They had been howling and got answers from the Mollies on the Amethyst Bench. From Laurie ~ This group of Mollies was different than yesterday's group. This group included gray adult female 978F who is not putting any weight on her front foot, a gray yearling or adult, 2 black pups, a black with white on the muzzle and another possible black yearling. Rick is thinking that some of the pups stayed with limping along 978F yesterday and were late to the Mollie party yesterday. We also have to make some corrections here. The 5 blacks last evening standing in the misty rain were on Amethyst Bench not Norris. It was most likely this young group of Mollies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mollies and Prospects ~ Back to Doug ~ The Prospects were undaunted and crossed theriver and headed up onto the Jasper Bench. At least some of the Mollies had moved to the west on the back side of the Jasper Bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "There hadn't been any howling for a while so I'm sure thepacks didn't really know where the other pack was. Unfortunately we had a low hanging cloud which closed off our view for a bit and when it lifted we couldn't find either pack. At one point I think they were about 300 yards apart. They were definitely wet wolves so maybe they could tell by scent where the others were.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Laurie ~ Rick was at a different angle and did see the Prospects run from the Mollies. Not big time but they were not staying around. Now we are thinking that possibly the 996M Group thought that this Mollie's group was the alpha group from yesterday so spooked them off. 996M Group has the older wolves but I think they did not want to stay around and check it out. Best to run first and ask questions later. \n",
      "\n",
      "From Doug ~ Some updates from yesterday. The Canyons were seen yesterday way to the south.  I'm not sure how many there were but the white female was definitely memorable for those reporting in. Also in the afternoon yesterday, there were 3 wolves seen on the bison carcass at Hellroaring where I had the grizzly yesterday.\n",

Three of them were at the carcass site and one was quite a ways from the carcass.

      "\n",
      "Junction ~ Yes, and then there were 6. We have been looking and looking all of these days for Junctions with 969's signal blaring like she was standing next to you! So frustrating. It was again our lucky day that Josh A. was cruising Little America and spotted the Junctions just a little west of Straight Away to the north. They were on the flats in a dried up pond. The 3 black pups, of course, jumped out at you. They have the most gorgeous coats with silver streaking throughout. That often happens with blacks between birth and age 1. The grays including 907F, 969F and the gray female yearling were harder to spot in the wheaten grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the black pups had part of a carcass that looked to be possibly a young coyote. It was difficult to tell, but it was furry with big ears. The ungulate calves are too big to have been this. This pup was so proud of his prize. The adult wolves had no interest in the carcass which could also be an indicator that it was a canid as the wolves do not usually consume other canids. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pup headed up the eastern Peregrine with the remains and tried to hide it from his siblings. Well, that didn't work well as the others easily scent trailed the little guy as did the eagles and ravens. The pack reached the ridge and went back and forth, in and out of view. Not long after, they all headed west towards Boulder and were out of our view. Doug M. did find them from Boulder but, unfortunately, it was a quick view and we did not find them again. The wind was relentless making it very difficult to look through one's scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all talking about the Junction Pack who numbered 19 a few months ago. As some of you will remember, I always say this to the pups, \"Live it up today as you do not know what is down the road.\" To watch all these little bundles from the day they roll out of the den makes their loss even harder. Those missing at the moment are 3 gray pups, the black female yearling, and gray male yearling 994M. We know that 994M is around and we are hoping that the others are with him. But today, there stood 6 from the once 19. What a difference only a few months can make.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies ~ Another exciting day at Hellroaring with 5 grizzlies around the carcass. Dusty said that they were very entertaining this morning with two siblings rocking and rolling and having a swim in the creek. The big bear maintained possession but other bears entertained the idea of getting on it. It must be a bison to have been so active for so many days. A grizzly sow and coy were seen in Little America making their way to the east close to midday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hayden ~ Karen E. reported that she and others had 3 Wapiti pups, 2 grays and a black, in the Sour Creek Rendezvous. The wind was even worse down there so thanks to Karen and others for standing out in it! Bob L. reported seeing two blacks in Cascade Meadow during the morning hours as well.

      "Junctions ~ First thing in the dark this morning we could see nothing on the elk carcass in Lamar. We went down to Coyote to look for the Junctions to the south. While we were there, Bill H. found a nice grizzly coming to the carcass. For some reason, maybe a shy bear, he did not stay long and headed for the high country. We later saw it from Coyote heading up Amethyst. That was about it for the carcass during the first half of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chris a guide in the Park for the day did find the Junctions up on the Southern Divide Ridge. It is roughly south of Fishermen's. Annie and Dusty found them about the same time as the wolves formed a serpentine line winding up on the deep chocolate trails made by many that had passed that way before them. Dusty was on Dorothy's Hill and he could see the two leading grays that chased a black to the west. It was not a hard chase and I think that it is a chase that has happened many times before. I think that this is a male from the Prospect 996M Group. He is most likely smitten with the 4 females in the pack and thinks that he would be dandy as the alpha male. Both 907F and 969F currently get headaches when they see him. Breeding season will come soon enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "The females led their family of 11 higher and higher towards the skyline. The pups, of course, were hippity skippity all the way. The black stayed bedded off to the right of them and Dusty could see him. He did eventually start to head to the right in the direction of where the pack was. He stays just close enough to be annoying!\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Lamar and went to Antelope in hopes of finding them come over the top of Specimen. Not today. We had two groups of bunched up elk which gave us some hope until we noticed the bulls that were herding them. I guess those guys were still holding out hope for some breeding opportunities. We stayed for quite a while and then headed home.\n",

      "Wapiti ~ Busy day down in the Hayden Valley. Here is Alan C.'s report ~As we came out of the tree line heading into the Hayden Valley, how were we to know that we were passing all nine Wapitis just 70 yards away? It was before sunrise, we were hurrying to get to Grizzly Overlook to see if they were still on the carcass, and none of us looked between the river and the road at the Mary Mountain Trailhead. But there they were, eating an elk carcass that they had killed in the night. We missed them completely and we continued on to Grizzly Overlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at Grizzly Overlook at about 7:10, and Jon and Karen E. were already there and they said that there were no wolves in sight, and that it looked like the carcass was completely gone. Hoping that the wolves were still in the area, we opted to go to the meadow for a slightly closer look. After about twenty minutes of searching, Karen E. said that she had three blacks to the west.\n",

      "Moving across the road, we were able to see the three adult blacks and the gray female yearling trotting along the Mary Mountain Trail. The three blacks went up to the top of the cut bank to the south of Alum Creek, the yearling was in the flats below, and then they all started howling. We thought we heard answering howling from the west, but were unsure. The yearling kept looking back to the east, and sure enough, here came all four pups! We also saw two hikers who had no idea that they were sharing the trail with wolves. The pups raced across the flats and disappeared behind a swale at Alum Creek. By about 7:50, we had all of the Wapitis disappear into the tree line at Alum Creek, except for the alpha female. We assumed that the female was in front, and it was the earlier possible howling we had heard. Since the hikers were on the trail, we believed that we wouldn't see the wolves for the rest of the day. Of course, all of this time, we had several visitors with us, looking through our scopes, and taking pictures. However, at around 7:55, a young visitor, Gwyneth Webster, was looking back to the East and told her dad that there was a wolf that he needed to take a picture of. He did, and promptly told us all that he had a good picture of \"the wolf behind us\". He showed me the picture, and I realized it was the alpha female.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alpha female was trotting south above the river, but would occasionally stop to do a little mousing. Everybody moved back to Grizzly Overlook, where we were able to watch her as she continued south. Several cars did the classic, what are you looking at?.... a wolf was our reply. They immediately jumped out, and were able to watch the female as she continued down to the river near the island. As she went below the trees, and farther south, we all headed south.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I headed down the hill, I saw the female swimming the river a little farther down. I quickly snapped a few pictures as she got out and ran across the road. It was about 8:40 when she headed up a gully and started trotting north and west. Realizing she was heading towards the last sighting of the other wolves, I went back to Grizzly Overlook, climbed the hill, and arrived just in time to see her come down the next hill onto the sage flats. She stopped, howled, and then turned farther to the west and started running. And just about then, a visitor asked if we had seen the elk carcass next to the road at Mary Mountain? He showed me a picture of an elk which had obviously been killed and partially consumed by wolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "After watching the alpha female stop and howl a couple of times, continue running towards the western trees, and finally disappear into the trees about 9:00, several of us went to see the carcass. As we approached the Mary Mountain Trailhead, we saw that the NPS had already retrieved the carcass and were hauling it away. They said that they hadn't seen any tracks, but it was definitely scavenged by wolves, so we went out to the site. We found several wolf tracks, of at least two different wolves, and from the coagulation of the blood, we realized we had passed the entire Wapiti pack just 70 yards away earlier that morning feasting on the elk.... if only I had looked left as I came out of the trees into the Hayden!\n",

      "Grizzlies ~ Bill found grizzlies Raspberry and Snow at 10:15 today near Lake Butte.  At 2:05, from Antelope, Bill found a dark grizzly near a location called Gunsite by bear watchers and then went out of sight in 1/2 hour back into the trees. Tonight at 6:30, Bill had a nice grizzly on the Number 3 Finger of Norris and then it went across the Number 4 Finger of Norris in the Soda Butte Valley. Bill said that 5 grizzlies was a very good day for this time of the year.\n",

      "\n",
      "Very early just after first light, we had wonderful howling just in the front of us from Footbridge in the Soda Butte Valley. It was several wolves as we all desperately tried to find them. Our eyes were first struck with a black in the willows but..... it was a grizzly bear but just behind him came 4 black wolves including 926F and Little T. We later learned that the big collared black wolf is 949M from the Beartooth Pack in Wyoming. He is a huge wolf with a white face, square-like body, and short very busy tail; striking. The other uncollared black is also a male. He is darker than Little T and has a tail that is a bit messed up. 949M was doing raised leg urinations everywhere with her coming after him a few times, not always. Not sure how happy she is with the arrangement. Only Little T approached 949M with a bit of interaction, but not for long. The other uncollared black did a lean forward over the alpha male's scent mark. \n",
      "\n",
      "Excitement rippled through the crowd, as they were so close, but the real surprise was the grizzly! He was \"hanging\" with the wolves. If he got ahead of them, he would look back, and return to them. He looked to be a young bear with not a lot of fat on him. The group headed towards and up onto Dead Puppy Hill with the bear in tow. He stayed right up with them until the wolves took a turn to the north. You wouldn't recognize 926F in all her fat and fur. She led the pack as her nose was to the ground taking her across the creek and across the road up towards the den area to the north. The bear carried on to the east along the creek. These males did not seem to have a problem with the road. Living outside Cooke City, may have prepared them for the people and cars.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We lost them soon after they crossed the road heading north. My guess was that she was headed to the north as far as she could go. I was right this time as Carolyn from YA let us know that they were in Lamar Valley on a carcass north of Hubbard Hill! By the time we got there, the foursome was moving farther north towards the crescent hill. They kept looking back as to bid farewell to their meal. Too many people. My guess is that they encountered the elk far to the north and gave chase forcing the elk towards the river hoping to take refuge in the river. It didn't make it as the wolves got it a few hundred yards from the road. I say an elk, but we could not see it. The coyotes, eagles, ravens and magpies were having a hay day at there surprise meal. The coyotes just moved from the carcass to the south of Hubbard to another fresh meal to the north of Hubbard Hill. Their ship has come in for the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wolves continued up the hill always keeping an eye on their kill hoping that at any moment the cars and people would disappear. When they reached skyline, they gave it one last look and headed over the top at skyline. We were able to see them again for only a brief moment north of Picnic, so continuing on their way to the north. Hopefully, they were just off for a nap and we will see them this evening.\n",

      "Natalie, Melba and Karen reported Wapitis on a carcass in Hayden Valley. Here is Karen's report ~ Dusty called and told me they had the Wapitis in Hayden Valley. They had 5 to the west and howling to the east. We arrived at about 8:15AM and several had scopes already up. Right off the bat, we could see 5 Wapitis to the west on a carcass. We saw the black pup alone to the east, near Sour Creek rendezvous. We watched the pup and would return to the rest of the pack to the west. After a while, the pup went to the river and looked like she was going to go to the road and cross. But, instead, she headed into the trees and out of sight. At about 10AM, here she came running to the carcass from the right. We do not know where she crossed the road.\n",

But it was an excellent morning with all 9 wolves present and accounted for!\n",

      "Canyon ~ Yesterday afternoon, visitors did see all 6 of the Canyons in Gibbon Meadow. This morning, Jim and Debbie did see them again as they crossed in front of them around the Indian Creek Campground. We looked for them today as we were down there but did not have any luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti ~ Kathie and Bob L. were down in Hayden early and Bob spotted the Wapiti just west of the road at Trout Creek. They were bedded. All of a sudden they jumped up as if startled and they went farther out to the west on the ridge and over the top. A grizzly was following them so that must have been what alerted them. They lost them at that juncture. When they found them again they were much farther away. The pups were having fun chasing the bison.  Kathie noticed that the uncollared black male did a raised leg on the sage. Then the alpha female came along and marked the same spot and then 1015M sealed the deal with his raised leg. We are watching these males closely to see exactly who comes out on top as the alpha.\n",
      "\n",
      "They bedded once again even further out. The bear was still in their company. The black pup challenged the bear by trying to get a bite in. That was a mistake. She won't try that again. That is how you have to learn I guess.\n",

      "Grizzlies ~ Another tough day finding wolves. All the way to Hellroaring where there ended up being 4 grizzlies in the general area of the carcass. It is wonderful to see these gorgeous bruins looking so fat and healthy with luscious coats that just ripple in the sunlight as they meander along. We also had the little grizzly in the same place as yesterday in Lamar Valley. Deby found another grizzly at Tower to bring Bill's total to 6 bears today.\n",
      "\n",

      "Prospect ~ We all owe Josh A. a huge thank you for doing whatever he could to let us know that he had wolves in Lamar. He had them in sight and had to go through the Lamar Canyon to get us on the radio to let us know. We are all so grateful. While he was away trying to get in touch with us, the wolves disappeared so when we all arrived there were none in view. They couldn't have gotten far. Luckily, they were to the south making it easier to scan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kathie and I were at the barn, and Kathie spotted them on the Southern Divide Ridge which is basically south and west of Coyote Overlook. It was the Prospects with 5 blacks and 12 grays were making their way in a straight line up a game trail towards the skyline. We looked closer to try to ID them. It was so difficult at such a distance. Alpha male 966M or alpha female 821 was coming along behind a black. The black looked back and saw the gray coming and tucked its tale and went to the ground in submission while the gray stood over it with a high tail. It looks as though we had the pack back together joining the alpha group and the 996M Group. We were missing 763M. The one we call Black Bar was there and I think that Halter Black was there as well. They can't be strutting their \"alphaness\" that they have in the 996M Group. No with this group it is submitting to the \"real\" alphas.\n",

      "Wapiti ~ Natalie reported that Hayden Valley was fogged in until 10:00. Around noon watchers gathered at Alum West and did hear faint howling that seemed to be getting louder. Melba scanned and did see four of the Wapitis. By the time others got their scopes on only 2 were still in view. It was a quick, quick sighting.

      "Lamar Canyon ~ We started the day off with looking for the Lamar Canyon wolves. They were somewhere nearby. We all spread out and I was lucky to find them on the bottom flank of Mt. Norris at the South end of the Soda Butte Valley. They were all there bedded but soon were up and off to the southeast happy snappy. We lost them quickly into the Chalcedony Fan/Lamar River area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the afternoon, we thought that we would see them again, but we searched the whole south side of the Lamar Valley and some to the north with no luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospects Part 1 ~ While we were looking for and watching Lamars, Bill called with a sighting at Tower. He had two blacks and a gray. By the time I got there, they had moved off to the east. We looked from Wrecker and did see the gray but no blacks. We did hear howling and the gray seemed to be going towards wolves she knew. Josh A. found a black in Little America just east of Boulder. By the time we got there, the wolves were bedded in a pond area near an old carcass just slightly west of Boulder. It was Prospects. We had black Small Dot, Black Bar and a gray female yearling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We watched them bedded for quite a while and then they moved east. We had howling to the south and I was able to find the black Prospect pup to the south. It, too, soon went out of sight. \n",
      "\n",
      "We did not see those wolves again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospects Part 2 ~ We had learned from Alwyn that they had had a great sighting at Hellroaring earlier in the morning. We headed over there, where Karen E. was able to show us some of the other Prospects including 966M, 821F, 996M, 2 gray pups and a gray yearling. Earlier in the morning, they had seen another black. The wolves were not on the old carcass there but we think had a carcass somewhere as they were full as ticks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of up down and turn around. They eventually moved left and out of our sight. They were very low so we were not able to pick them up again. Before leaving, I did see a black way up slope. Three elk had their eyes on it as it followed the tree line up. Eventually, it, too, went into the trees. \n",
      "\n",
      "We left there about 3:00 or so to head back to Lamar. So our total on Prospects today in both locations would be 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies ~ We had two grizzlies at the carcass area at Hellroaring today. Bill also found a nice blonde grizzly on the Ski Slope south in the Lamar. We traveled down to Picnic looking for Lamars and Rick picked up another big grizzly in the big fan.\n",
      "\n",

Hopefully he is with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not stay around the carcass long. It was hoist anchor and be on your way time. They started climbing the Hellroaring slope at a reasonable pace with the pups playing hard along the way. The sight of them tends to bunch up the elk, but with full bellies, they just continued on their way. Loads and loads of elk can be seen all over there, so a very reasonable place for wolves to be. The sun was in our eyes and the sage was thick so following them was not easy. One of the female yearlings was very aggressive to the other pinning her many times. This is not unusual for sisters in a wolf pack trying to get the pecking order worked out. They eventually reached a small sage covered hill and bedded on it.\n",
      "\n",

      "Prospect 964M and a black ~ Some visitors saw a gray collared wolf sitting near the road near Fishermen's. An uncollared wolf was seen with it around 10:00 this morning. We were lucky to catch up with them at Slough and they had photos. It was 964M and probably the missing black from the main Prospect Pack back at Hellroaring. They said he crossed to the north and headed on up to Secret Passage. He would be the missing gray from Prospect and the black is probably one of the 2 blacks missing from the group we had this morning. \n",

We know that 994M is moving around in the Hellroaring area because of his collar. There have been no sightings, however. The last group we saw together was 907F, 969F, 3 gray pups and the gray female yearling. I am hoping that the black pups and female yearling are with 994M.  We just don't know.\n",

I asked Warren to please go to Trout Creek.Warren and Julie climbed the eastern hill first. At 9:45AMthey quickly called me to come as they had 5 of the 9 Wapitis in view. We soon had acquired all 9 of them.\n",

Here they wereon the other side of the Yellowstone River. The whole pack, especially the pups, were eyeing a bison herd. A big bull charged the alpha female sending her running off. Amazingly one of the gray pups sat directly behind the bull bison. The black pup and an adult black sat to the left of the bison. At one point the whole packwas in a circle around the bison. They milled around each other and then gathered together as a group with some moving left to right and some right to left\n",

      "? wolves ~ This morning visitors reported having 3 blacks and 3 grays in the Slough den area last evening. Hard to tell who they were. Junction 969F is in about the same place she was yesterday, so we are thinking it is not the Junctions. We looked for 969F from Blacktail out towards Prospect Peak but had no luck in finding her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospect ~ Bill, once again, had spotted a bear AND wolves from Hellroaring. When I arrived the Prospects were up and moving to the west. All of a sudden, they encountered elk and the chase was on in many directions. Those trees at that pullout are so troublesome. We were all running around trying to see. I finally got a spot where I could see the chase as the elk zig-zagged back and forth with the wolves right on her. She ran to Hellroaring Creek and with a splash hit the water. The wolves were not daunted and went in right after her. She looked like she was going deeper but then got out on the other side. The wolves were on her again so back into the water she went. She moved toward the old bison carcass the bears have been on. It is very shallow there. A collared gray, we think 821F, on one side of the elk made contact at the neck with others at the rear end. She held onto the neck for a good while but the elk managed to break free but slipped on the rocks in the shallow water which ended up being the final blow. She was not able to recover from that and 821F was, again, on her throat and it was over. It was maybe 8 minutes from first initial attack to the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was basically 5 wolves in the take down including the alphas. It for sure was 821F on the neck. As they had their fill, they slowly emerged from the water onto dry land. I can imagine how cold it would be in the river. The swift current moved the carcass slightly down creek and basically out of sight. We could see wolf shapes behind the willows but really had a hard time. It must have lodged itself on some rocks anchoring itself in place. Eagles and ravens arrived to round out the scene around the carcass. Doug McCartney found a grizzly that appeared to be heading towards the carcass but it did not appear before we left.\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one the wolves came out of the water for a good shake and made there way to the top of a small hill overlooking a golden dry pond. There were a few Johnny-come-latelys that got to the dining table late. They had been chasing other elk! Black Bar was one of them. I was thinking that alpha male 966 possibly did not appreciate him being around his family. My question was answered when Black Bar came to the bedded pack after his feed. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a lot of rallying behavior going on with tails wagging and tongues flying. I think that they were all quite giddy with themselves and their carcass. As we have said there are so many elk at Hellroaring that it has to be a wolves delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some behaviors we noticed within the pack structure. Alpha 966M was very possessive of 821F mounting her at least 10-11 times. It was almost more than she could take making her turn and snap at him. It is a little too early for all of that!! 821F made herself busy pinning the black female yearling we are calling Halter Bar. She was relentless keeping the female crouched all the time. We think that Halter Bar possibly did breed last year. That would make her pups compete with 821's. That's a biggy in the wolf world. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long until we saw Black Bar emerge from the carcass area and head towards the pack. He did not start out quickly but soon quickened his pace as he lifted his tail and joined the family. He was greeted and there was no pinning of him by 966M. I think that Black Bar is ok with being second fiddle to 966M. Black Bar was busy running around after 964M who would be in third position male. Black Bar would take him down at any chance keeping 964M on the fringe. We think that the black pup is on 3 legs with a front left out of commission. Everyone else was happy snappy. We were missing 763M and 996M. We worry about 763M sometimes but last year we thought he had passed and he was up and going in a few days, so you just never know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti ~ From Karen E. We received a call from Dusty at 7AM telling us that they had a grizzly bear and Wapitis at Grizzly Overlook. When arrived a few minutes later, we saw 1 large grizzly bear near the Wapiti wolves. The bear moved east to the trees and out of sight. We think they may have had a carcass as the pups were sniffing around and occasionally picking up a bone or would be chewing something. The adults bedded down in the same spot all morning, with an occasional shift of position or movement. The pups would be up and down, in sight and out of sight all morning. The black pup and one of the gray pups were busy mousing and trying to wake up the others to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wapiti afternoon from Laurie ~ It was a beautiful day and our last chance to see the Wapitis, so Kathie and I headed down after the Prospects bedded. We were lucky to see them and get a good idea of the hierarchy in the pack. It pretty much shakes out that 1015M is the alpha male, the uncollared black male pinned 1014M making him the second male. The pups were in the mud mousing as the adults snoozed on the bank. They were down for some time before getting up and heading north. We could see them from Grizzly Overlook chasing bison. It is futile as the bison end up chasing them!! They continued on and out of our sight. It was great to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grizzlies ~ Bill found one grizzly at Hellroaring this morning when he found the wolves. Doug Mc. found another grizzly at Hellroaring this morning. Josh reported a sow with possibly 2 COYs in Little America this afternoon, and of course, the grizzly with the Wapitis this morning.\n",

      "We had a beautiful morning with the Prospects. Luckily for us, Bob L. is on the Northern Range. We were all spread out looking for wolves from Lamar to Hellroaring. Bob went out on Bob's spot glassing the Slough flats and ridges all around. He was able to spot the Prospect wolves in the saddle of the ridge. They headed straight down to the flats, we lost for a bit, and then picked back up by Jeff A. from Dave's Hill heading east along the creek and were settling in at the bottom of the Lion Meadow. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the time we got there, they had just about settled. We had 6 grays including 966M, 821M, 964M, 2 gray pups, one female yearling. This dark throated yearling was pinning and making the life of the other female yearling so intolerable, the other female yearling may have just taken a break from the pack. The blacks included 996M, Black Bar, Halter Bar, Small Dot, and the black pup. His leg was much better today.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were just moving along happy, snappy. Those pups don't let up. They are taking advantage of their young age while the adults are all flopped out sleeping. Lots of antlers and buffalo wallows perfect for the young pups. Live it up while you can. Halter Bar kept her distance from 821F. 964M kept his distance while staying a part of the family. \n",

      "We had them for a good two hours as they slept and then made their way to the Yellow Grass Meadow and out of sight. Lots and lots of smiles from happy visitors.\n",
